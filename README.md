# 2048
A modfification of 2048 

Play the original here (http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

The app of the original game can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)

Changes made from original:

Tiles only merge if at least one of them is a prime

The random tile spawned in is:

50% of the time a 2
40% of the time a 4
10% of the time a 3

Your score is equal to your highest tile

You only start with one tile (what a difference!)

Hints:

2s and 3s can be combined with anything
4s have to be combined with a prime number

Odd numbers are useful as only odd numbers (and 2) are primes. Try not to combine them!

It may be useful to have a list of prime numbers open
